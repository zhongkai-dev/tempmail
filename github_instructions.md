# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
2. Select the necessary scopes (at minimum, select "repo")
3. Generate the token and copy it
4. Use the token in place of your password when pushing:

```
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for password, use the PAT instead of your GitHub password.

## Option 2: Push using HTTPS with credentials in URL
